# Matching Game

Hello this is a game that I built using TypeScript and the Phaser framework.

Many thanks goes to Casualino Games for providing experience and Ivailo Dimitrov for the project guidance.

This is my first dabble in TypeScript and Web games.





# Version History:

Disabled animations on opening and closing of the cards, because I can't manage to fix the animations when multiple tiles are clicked very fast. Also to help speed the game on smartphones.
Changed the game sounds.

1.0.0 
Prepared for release, removed console log information, and updated source code.
